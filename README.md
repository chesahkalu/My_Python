# Random_python_basics
- Some random beginer python codes, creating and solving problems with basic python algorithms.
- The codes on here are meant to act like a beginer's notes on the basics of python programming.
- They are personal random tasks from different sources during my early days of learning and practicing python programming.
- This README will contain a basic decription of the code content of each file.
- In each file will contain comments like notes  stating the basic description and reason of functions,algorithms and syntax.
## Tasks
[1-yourname.py](./1-yourname.py) : This contains codes describing the various string inputs and outputs, including basic rules on
formating and casting while using `print` functions.

[2-index_slicing.py](./2-index_slicing.py) : This provides some of the basic rules on indexing and slicing through basic string variable,
which also works for lists.

[3-simple_calculator.py](./3-simple_calculator.py): A simple calculator showing basic oprations;
use of the input function on run, and split funtions during input.
Also shows use of various flow commands such as `if` , `elif`.

[4-fizzbuzz.py](./4-fizzbuzz.py): The almighty fizzbuzz. Shows how to loop through a range of numbers and uses flow command to print either
`Fizz` if the number is a multiple of `3`, `Buzz` if it is a multiple of `5` and `Fizzbuzz` if they are multiples of both `3 and 5`.

[5-interest_rate.py](./5-interest_rate.py): Calculating and printing interest rate when given initial investment, rate and time.

[6-pine_tree.py](./6-pine_tree.py): This code prints a pictorial pine tree using the `#` symbol.
It shows how to manipulate end of lines,spaces and new lines.

[7-string_manipulators.py](./7-string_manipulators.py): This conatains a handfull of functions to manipulate strings.

[8-random_list.py](./8-random_list.py): This shows usage of the python `random` function in creating a random list of integers.

[9-print_ranging.py](./9-print_ranging.py): The `range` function and how it is used.

[10-loop_brk_cnt.py](./10-loop_brk_cnt.py): Some code showing the `while true` loop function, including `break` and `continue`

[11-try_except.py](./11-try_except.py): shows how to use the `try except` function.

# Random_python_basics
- Some random beginer python codes, creating and solving problems with basic python algorithms.
- The codes on here are meant to act like a beginer's notes on the basics of python programming.
- They are personal random tasks from different sources during my early days of learning and practicing python programming.
- This README will contain a basic decription of the code content of each file.
- In each file will contain comments like notes  stating the basic description and reason of functions,algorithms and syntax.
## Tasks
[1-yourname.py](./1-yourname.py) : This contains codes describing the various string inputs and outputs,include formats and cast
on basic printing function rules.
